Device will use BMP280 and DHT11 sensors to record the temperature, air pressure, and humidity to an SD card, at least every two minutes across 24 hours. Two temperature readings will be logged, one from the DHT11 and one from the BMP280. The data will be written to the SD card in a way that can be copied into Microsoft Excel
